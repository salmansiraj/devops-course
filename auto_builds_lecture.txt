Lecture 3 (Automating Builds):
    - Build tools are programs that automate the creating of various 
        involved in some project 
    - The thing built may be a complete program, portion of a program,
        documentation, database config, Docker container
    
    - make: Used to specify a dependency followed by a rule 
        - Runs through all compilations and linking sourcecode
    - Maven: Build tool uses XML that will will perform any kind of build, 
        deploy, test and release task with a single command as long as we
        conform to the structure dictated by Maven. 
    
    - makefile structure:
        - Target, that we seek to build
        - List of dependencies. which tagets depend on 
        - Commands to be run to build target from its dependencies 
        - Components will be assembled together via makefile 

    CI/CD
    CI: Continuous Integration
        - Code should be pushed to master regularly making sure that it integrates
            with other code in branch 
            - Running auto code quality tests 
            - Building exec from code 
            - Reporting on code testing coverage 
            - Building docker container that can be used to deploy code 
    
    CD: Continuous Delivery 
        - Result of the continuos integration is delivered to place to run. 
            lace can be test server/dev/production, etc.
        - Eg. Travis CI & Jenkins 

    Jenkins: 
        - Automates product pipeline
        1. Pulls from repository
        2. At anytime, can submit new code to CI Server to create a build (using maven)
        3. Validates tests that were created, if invalidated prevents from build
            to break and goes back to developer
        4. Then goes to tester, where it validates if the code matches the rest of the 
            code in the current build
        5. Then you release and deploy/deliver
    
    Travis CI uses YAML file for configurations and webhooks: 
        - Contains directives as to how to build should be performed 
        - Directived specify what to install, services to employ, 
            set envirable variables, main script to run, install sections, 
            and directions of what to do if build succeed or fails
